# Sign up

## Sign up for a RCIAM Account

You need to sign up for an account for accessing the RCIAM services. As part of
this process you will be assigned a personal unique **RCIAM ID** which will be
then used across all RCIAM tools and services. Follow the instructions below to
get started:

1. Go to <https://rciam.example.org/signup>. This will show you the identity provider
   discovery page: browse through the list of Identity Providers to find your
   Home Organisation, _or, alternatively,_ type the name of your Home
   Organisation in the search box. Note that the names are localised based on
   the selected language.

   Organisation

3. After successful authentication, you may be prompted by your Home
   Organisation to consent to the release of personal information to the **RCIAM
   AAI Service Provider Proxy**.

4. After successful authentication, you will be redirected to the RCIAM account
   registration form. On the introductory page, click **Begin** to start the
   registration process.

   If you do not find the email
   in your Inbox, please check your Spam or Junk folder for an email from "RCIAM
   AAI Notifications". If you do find the email in these folders, mark the email
   as "safe" or "not spam" to ensure that you receive any future notifications
   about your RCIAM ID.

    using the Identity Provider you selected before.
