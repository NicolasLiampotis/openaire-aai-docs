# Overview

OpenAIRE Login enables researchers to securely access and share common
resources and services using identities from eduGAIN, the global network of
academic identity federations. For users coming from the industry or citizen
scientists who may not have access to eduGAIN, the OpenAIRE Login service
supports additional trusted authentication providers, such as social networks,
community identity providers and other platforms such as ORCID that can provide
federated user identities. OpenAIRE Login allows connecting services using
popular protocols, such as OpenID Connect and SAML, to securely authenticate
and identify their users, organise them in groups, assign them roles and
centrally manage access rights for accessing protected resources.
