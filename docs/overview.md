# Overview

Identity Access Management for Research Communities (RCIAM) enables researchers
to securely access and share common resources and services using identities
from eduGAIN, the global network of academic identity federations. For users
coming from the industry or citizen scientists who may not have access to
eduGAIN, RCIAM supports additional trusted authentication providers, such as
social networks, community identity providers and other platforms such as
ORCID that can provide federated user identities. RCIAM allows connecting
services using popular protocols, such as OpenID Connect and SAML, to securely
authenticate and identify their users, organise them in groups, assign them
roles and centrally manage access rights for accessing protected resources.
